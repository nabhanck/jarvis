# 🧠 Jarvis AI - Personal Voice Assistant

This project was created for the final project submission in CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python. Later I decided as bonus to create a visual frontend and deploy it as my first react app with python backend and logic

A personal AI assistant inspired by Jarvis, built using:
- 🧑‍💻 React (Vite) for the frontend
- 🐍 Python Flask for the backend
- 🎤 Text-to-speech (TTS) with Web Speech API
- 🌐 External APIs for weather, movies, books & more

## 🎯 Features

- 🔊 Voice-enabled responses
- ⌨️ Terminal-style chat interface
- 🎬 Movie recommendations by category/language (TMDB API)
- 📚 Book recommendations
- 📆 Date/time responses
- ☁️ Weather info (with location prompt)
- ➕ Simple math expression evaluation
- 🧠 Context-aware follow-up questions (e.g. weather asks for location)
